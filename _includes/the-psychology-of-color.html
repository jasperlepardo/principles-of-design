It is a fun, energetic hue found in the branding of many sports teams. Not unlike red or yellow, orange is used to draw attention—in traffic cones and advertising collateral. Consumers tend to associate the color orange with value, in fact, a reality that brands like Home Depot have capitalized on. On the physical end of the spectrum it evokes comfort like food, warmth, and shelter. It is the color of sunset, citrus, and pumpkins, forever linked to fall and Halloween for American customers. This is especially the case when it is paired with black, which lends it a tone of cartoonish dread and frivolity. Emotions central to the color orange comprise the following.</p>

A green world is a safe world, one that is lush, full of water, and life-giving. For this reason it’s a reassuring color. Like all colors, though, green has its negative side. It is at once the symbol of health and sickness, luck and jealousy. The list of green’s emotive attributes includes:</p>

      <p>If your project is about health, fitness or well-being, there is a great opportunity to use soft greens with natural, earthy tones.</p>
      <p>Green is also the ‘go’ colour for a lot of people, as this is it’s meaning on road signs around Europe and North America.
